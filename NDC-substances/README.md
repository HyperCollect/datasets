## INFO
This is a temporal higher-order network dataset, which here means a sequence of timestamped simplices where each simplex is a set of nodes. Under the Drug Listing Act of 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration releases information on all commercial drugs going through the regulation of the agency, forming the National Drug Code (NDC) Directory. In this dataset, each simplex corresponds to an NDC code for a drug, and the nodes are substances that make up the drug. Timestamps are in days and represent when the drug was first marketed. We restricted to simplices that consist of at most 25 nodes.
